# Serendipity SEO Plugin

This is a plugin to interface the [*serendipity blog platform*](http://www.s9y.org/) with
* Facebook Opengraph
* Twitter
* Google Publisher
* More!

This is not complete, so if you stumble upon it, use at your own risk.

## Goals are:
* Write a lightweight plugin to add helpful meta tags to the header for each entry

## Notes:
* This used to be the serendipity_event_opengraph plugin
